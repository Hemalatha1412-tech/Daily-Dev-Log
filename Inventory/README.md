📦 Excel-Integrated Inventory Manager
This project is a professional implementation of Data Persistence and Business Logic using Python. It bridges the gap between raw code and industry-standard tools like Microsoft Excel.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Data Persistence: Utilizes the csv module to read/write persistent data, ensuring information survives program restarts.

Business Intelligence: Features an automated Alert System that monitors stock levels against custom thresholds to prevent stock-outs.

Localization: Optimized for the Indian market with ₹ (Rupee) currency formatting and localized date structures.

Robustness: Employs os.path checking and try-except blocks for professional-grade error handling and file safety.

📋 Inventory Schema
The system manages a diverse range of hardware and peripherals, tracking:

Item Name (e.g., Laptop, RAM Stick).

Current Quantity.

Reorder Threshold.

Unit Price (₹).
