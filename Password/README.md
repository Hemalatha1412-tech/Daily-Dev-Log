# CyberVault v4.0 - Secure Password Manager

This project demonstrates the implementation of a desktop-based security application focusing on **Information Hiding** and **User-Centric Design**.

## 🛠️ Technical Features
- **GUI Engineering**: Built with `customtkinter` for a modern, responsive interface.
- **Cryptography**: Utilizes a Caesar Cipher algorithm for "Encryption at Rest."
- **Data Integrity**: Implemented string sanitization to ensure high-fidelity data retrieval.
- **State Management**: Includes an authentication layer to protect the main dashboard.

## 🧠 CS Concepts Applied
- **HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)**: Prioritized manual input to reduce user confusion.
- **Information Retrieval**: Automated decryption during clipboard transfers.
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Managed application flow through user-triggered events.
